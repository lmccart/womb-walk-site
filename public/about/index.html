          How is our concept of family shaped by
          the rapidly expanding technological
          possibilities, and shifting
          understandings of gender, sexuality,
          identity, and intelligence? What new
          issues arise with the expanding use
          of assistive reproductive technology
          including in vitro fertilization, egg/
          sperm donation, surrogacy, egg/embryo
          freezing, DNA testing, and gene editing?
          These reproductive questions impact
          our lives but are rarely acknowledged
          publicly. As these tools become
          increasingly data-driven, how do our
          relationships to privacy, surveillance,
          networks, and family change? What is
          connection?

          Despite society’s emphasis on “information” and “transparency,” 
          issues of reproduction are rarely discussed openly. The womb 
          becomes a black box as topics of female sexuality and health are 
          seen as shameful or trivial, and we collectively fail to grapple 
          with the racist and ableist history of eugenics, contraception, 
          and other technologies of reproductive control. At the same time, 
          the medical-industrial birth complex aims to position itself as the 
          sole keepers of the technical knowledge to deliver desired 
          reproductive futures. This performance stands in acknowledge of all 
          the queer, trans, nonbinary, two-spirit, BIPOC, women, people with 
          reproductive organs, doulas, and midwives that have been the 
          original biohackers.
