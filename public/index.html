        <p>
          Will you be my imaginary baby?
          I wear a fake pregnancy belly prosthetic
          under my clothes, embedded with custom
          electronics. I walk around the city
          speaking to my belly, describing what I
          see around me as I move.
          You remotely join the walk in the role
          of the baby, listening to my voice via
          an app on their phone. Through this app,
          you are also able to control my movements
          by triggering small internal kicks to
          the sides of my belly directing me when
          to turn. Together, we navigate the city,
          with imagined baby as interface.
